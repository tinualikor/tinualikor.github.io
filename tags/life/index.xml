            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[<p><strong>Hey how are you?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m good, how are you?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to give these knee jerk responses to a casual question we hear daily. And I&rsquo;m by no means suggesting an episode of verbal diarrhoea with boundless content every time someone asks how you are at the supermarket checkout! That would be weird! But when you&rsquo;re in a safe place…and if you don&rsquo;t have a safe place, get one! A safe place, where you can be yourself, a person whom you trust. A real answer is just what the doctor ordered. Honesty breeds healing and progress and gives light to those dark areas in our lives.</p>

<p><strong>Hey how are you?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m exhausted, hungry, fed up, disappointed, lonely, depressed and anxious. I got a parking ticket yesterday, I&rsquo;ve got this lingering toothache. I haven&rsquo;t had a shower in two days. The laundry hasn&rsquo;t been done, I&rsquo;ve run out of detergent and milk but forgot to get some in the last shopping trip, so no tea for me today, I can&rsquo;t be dealing with black tea. My job is thankless and monotonous, and my boss hates me. The kids have given me a cold, so now my nose is streaming and as if I&rsquo;m not already sleep deprived enough I&rsquo;m coughing like a chain smoker on helium at night, wheezing and breathless. I&rsquo;m overdrawn on my overdraft, dealing with family conflict, and I think my wife is having an affair. with her personal trainer. We&rsquo;ve been secretly doing IVF and the pressure of the failed cycles is mounting, I&rsquo;m not sure our relationship can endure this battering. We have one last attempt left.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m having a bad hair week, this afro is about to get another big chop if it ain&rsquo;t careful, and I&rsquo;ve gained about 50 pounds in the last month. I need to book a GP appt for myself, I&rsquo;ve had this persistent problem and I need a solution not a placebo… but I&rsquo;m hoping it will just go away if I leave it long enough&hellip;</p>

<p>I woke up this morning and it took me longer than normal to convince myself to face the world. Everyday it seems to be getting more difficult. I&rsquo;ve called in sick a few times at work, but I can&rsquo;t pull a sicky on life. But my response as always if you care to ask is… I&rsquo;m fine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you can relate to any of this, but whatever your challenges and hurdles, whatever is keeping you up at night. It&rsquo;s ok not to be ok. </p>

<p>I see you holding everyone up, holding it all together. Trying to be solid like an ox. Putting on a brave face. Being the foundation that everyone needs, being the rock that you need. Putting everyone before yourself. I see you. I feel you. Carrying the weight around your neck. I see you in the small hours nursing, dreaming of sleep, writing your to do list in the dark, by the light of your phone, responding to messages you&rsquo;d forgotten you even had from last week. I see you awkwardly compressed between a rock and a hard place on your daily 2 hour commute. I see you, working in a job that daily robs you of your joy, quietly stuck in commuter pain, sandwiched between optimism and hopelessness surrounded by people who need to become familiar with deodorant. Overheating, overworked, underpaid and underappreciated. Wondering when the cycle will end. Hoping for deliverance, escape, or the luck of the Irish when that euro millions advert comes on. I see you doing the daily school run, sprinting from the car to the school gates, reciting the list of chores in your head as you head back to the car, praying for a day off. </p>

<p>You pick yourself up when things get tough. People sometimes ask you how you are but rarely listen for the truth. You make excuses for your nearest and dearest, no one seems to care enough, and you&rsquo;re alone, firefighting and trying to keep your head above water.</p>

<p>If we were honest about how we are feeling if not for public scrutiny, at least for ourselves then maybe we&rsquo;d find the strength to face them and stop saying we&rsquo;re ok, for fear of burdening others, being shunned by others, being misunderstood, or simply ignored. Or maybe sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to just pretend it&rsquo;s not happening and maybe it will all just go away…</p>

<p>Rarely… things rarely just disappear. Sometimes verbalising your truth brings it into reality, shit gets real when you start talking about it. Talking is good. Talking is freedom and relief. Talk to the right people, find solutions and support. But whatever you&rsquo;re going through, however tough or impossible it may seem, there will be an end. I hope you surround yourself with light and love. That you find beauty in ashes. Believe it or not, your worst day to someone else is a dream come true. This week has been exhausting for me on so many levels. I&rsquo;ve had to push through so much pain to get stuff done. I felt drawn to write this post for you to know you&rsquo;re not alone. Don&rsquo;t give up, and speak up. It&rsquo;s ok not to be ok.</p>

<p>Find someone to talk to, who’ll listen, someone you trust who cares, call the Samaritans or just message me, privately&hellip;you’re not alone, be heard.  Thanks for reading!

            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[<p>Are we the generation that just have too many options??</p>

<p>One where we dismiss potential partners with a quick flick, could easily go on a date a day if our schedules permitted and take pride in our mantra of choosing not to ‘settle’. Now what exactly is settling??</p>

<p>To settle actually means to resolve or reach an agreement about (an argument or problem). But in this modern age when we refer to settling in a relationship context we deem it to be negative and unsatisfactory. Let’s just go over this again….to settle is to reach an agreement or resolve and argument or problem. So if your problem is loneliness but your list of must haves includes a shiny full head of hair, and Bob comes along with a receding hairline who makes you laugh and texts you sweet nothings daily, then you’ve found a potential resolve to your problem. Is this settling? Now…how important is this hair issue…? Is it a deal breaker?? Will you have sleepless nights thinking about Bobs hair shedding on his pillow? Will you cringe every time you have to imagine running your hands through his non existent mane…? The world’s ending I know….I mean don’t get me wrong, I like a good head of hair along with the next girl. But if my problem is loneliness and I find a good man with follicle issues I’m going to snap that man up and go and hug a wig in the hair shop if it makes me feel better. If this is settling….according to the millenial Oxford definition, then I’m a settler and proud!!</p>

<p>“Settling” in a relationship context according to the urban dictionary means accepting significantly less than you want, because you don’t think you can get what you want. Apparently it doesn’t have anything to do with being “better” than the other person, but it does imply that you’re not actually passionate about the person and are simply taking what you can get.</p>

<p>Now this is where I disagree, and feel it to be more about perception. Having a list of 5 requirements in a partner and finding Bob only has 3 out of the five could be deemed as “settling”. If you perceive you have drawn the short straw and should in fact strive to find the holy grail and tick all 5 boxes then yes that is settling and will possibly leave you feeling discontent, unhappy and dissatisfied. However if your list of 5 requirements is admittedly unreasonable at best, or even mythical and on reflection they don’t mean much to you, then passing on the potential for love is a loss. What really matters to you? What do you regard as a game changer?</p>

<p>Settling is letting go of the things that are not important to you. The stuff that you can live without. It’s not compromising, or being defeated by fear. It’s changing your perception and saying yes more! Dating is such a minefield in this day. We swipe till our fingers hurt and have lost the art of conversation and getting beneath the hood, (no pun intended). We imagine our lives pictured in fairytales that make us hold out for the glass slipper when actually we’d be more suited to some comfy pumps. I’m all for having high standards and waiting for the ‘one’ but the truth is sometimes we can get caught up in the noise of apps and social media, and lose sight of what really matters.</p>

<p>Can you remember who you were before you were told who to be? Who to like, what to like? What to expect, what to achieve? How to achieve it? Finding the person whom you can’t live without can be a tall order, but if you get rid of the noise of perfection and settling, the journey may be a little easier. It’s so easy to sleep walk in to situations, but today I’m asking you to open your eyes and take the reigns back. It’s never too late to strive for what you want, don’t be overwhelmed or intimidated with the blur of choice that surrounds you. Only one person matters and that’s you.</p>

<p>It’s a jungle out there, there’s no denying that. In every sphere of life we have options and the decisions we make colour our path and provide the hinges to the doors that open and close in our lives. My wish for you is to find peace, happiness and contentment. Pursue what you want with vigour and passion. And settle for nothing less than your happiness.</p>
