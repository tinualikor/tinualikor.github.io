            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;When people tell me they don’t make plans or set goals I have to do a double take. I’m truly bewildered by the concept of living without direction or measuring your own progress. Goals give you something to dream of, aspire to, work towards. They help you focus your energy and productivity on the areas you choose. They may be scary to some, but they give me purpose and drive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes us so averse to setting goals and preferring to just go with the flow? Nothing wrong with a relaxed approach to life, but having no goals is essentially getting into a car with half a tank of petrol and no destination; you may enjoy the serendipitous journey but you’ll most likely be unprepared and eventually run out of petrol and potentially end up on the hard shoulder of a motorway going to Skegness, up the creek without a paddle as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent situations have reminded me of my mortality and given me the passion to enjoy every day like it was my last. I’m here to encourage you to step out and do something differently today. Challenge yourself to try something you’ve always wanted to, eat a new dish, go to a new park, swim in a new lake, dance to a new tune, travel to a new country. Don’t be bounded by people’s perception of you, what they think you can achieve, what they expect you to do, or even what you’ve conditioned your mind to accept you’re capable of. You are so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everyone told that they can’t&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every exam they said you’d fail that you passed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every dress they said you shouldn’t wear but did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every job they said you’d never get but did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every journey they told you not to take but completed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every man they told you not to be with but happily married&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every apology you deserved but never got&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every battle you fought when no one else would and won&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for all those doubters…may they continue to motivate you to be your best. May you always have your glass half full, living your best your life. May you continue to dream freely, and be intentional. Wishing you a limitless life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your dreams, your experiences and your stories no matter how big or small. Please like, share and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/tinualikor/&#34;&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I’m not great at following trends! I’d like to think I’m individual and try not to get swept away with fads and to be honest I’m about as ‘on trend’ as John McCririck or a stale Jaffa cake. Now I’m 35 I care less what people think, I wear what I like , rarely wear make up and generally enjoying the not giving a damn phase. Spending time with my family, sharing, loving, connecting rather than succumbing to the narcism that is gripping the world. I do however love to get dressed up when I have the opportunity and in remembrance of my party days, dancing on bars, crowd surfing (I never managed to pull that off successfully) falling into taxis, falling out of ubers and generally making magical hungover memories I’d like to master something I’ve never got the hang of. Lippy!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had the confidence or inclination to wear it, but recently on my journey to improving my confidence and getting involved with self care, I have admired so many who wear lippy with pride! It’s amazing how it can change your entire look and elevate you from casual to ‘oh hello’ in a few pouts! But it does take some confidence to wear it and that’s what I’m working on! Whilst I’m working on my groove, in tandem I need to find decent lippy to try and would love to see you with your favourite lippy on to give me some inspiration! So join me please and  #getlippy2019. Just post a picture of yourself with the hashtags #getlippy2019 and tell me what lippy you’ve got!! I can’t wait to see them all, share with others, the more the merrier! &lt;/p&gt;

            <description>1. Believe in yourself You need to be your own cheerleader.</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-believe-in-yourself&#34;&gt;1. Believe in yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to be your own cheerleader. Focus on the things you’re great at. Trust your own abilities. Remember the things you have achieved so far and use those memories as a foundation for the things you’d like to achieve in the future. Don’t be afraid to be heard. Your opinion is valuable and counts &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-silence-your-inner-critic&#34;&gt;2. Silence your inner critic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self deprecation needs to stop. When someone says you look great, say thank you. When someone congratulates you on a good job, again say thank you. Sometimes to silence the inner critic you need positive voices around you shouting louder! If you have no friends to reinforce Your good qualities and give you positive constructive feedback, then listen to energising talks, podcasts, videos, audio books, fill your spirit with so much positivity that the niggling inner critic will soon be drowned out… and reconsider your friendship circle! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-follow-through-with-what-you-say-you-will-do&#34;&gt;3. Follow through with what you say you will do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop procrastinating. Under promise and over deliver at first if you have to. But whatever you do, follow through. Differentiate between reasons and excuses. The more you get stuff done the more credible you will feel. It’s really as simple as that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-educate-yourself-stay-current&#34;&gt;4. Educate yourself - stay current.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge really is power and the more information you have the less you’ll feel like an imposter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-visualise-your-goals&#34;&gt;5. Visualise your goals &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create mind maps and mood boards. Someone once said to me ‘if you can see it you can have it’. Visualising your goals will make them more tangible, and on your road to a more confident you, make your vision of yourself a reality, but paint the picture first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-dress-to-impress-yourself&#34;&gt;6. Dress to impress yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason when you look good you feel good. When you put on your best you feel like you’re on the road to world domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-monitor-your-progress&#34;&gt;7. Monitor your progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence grows with progress, it’s really as simple as that. If you monitor your progress you can see just how far you’ve come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-be-shameless-and-stay-in-your-lane&#34;&gt;8. Be shameless and stay in your lane&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think less about what people think. Most people don’t have their ish together and are just faking it until they make it. Don’t worry about what others are doing or not doing! Don’t use other people as your benchmark for success. Just be you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-take-risks&#34;&gt;9. Take risks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk takers are history makers. Heard of the saying he who dares wins? Risks are not for the faint hearted but to really grow in confidence you have to do things that scare you, and in stepping out of your comfort zone, you’re winning already. It takes confidence to take risks and be bold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;10-do-more-of-what-makes-you-happy-and-you-re-good-at&#34;&gt;10. Do more of what makes you happy and you’re good at&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence is reinforced by joy. Be happy and confidence will exude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, please feel free to get in touch. I’ll be posting a new blog every Monday morning. You can follow me using the links on my site. Have a great week!&lt;/p&gt;
