            <description>Have you ever been so tired you start doing things that you’d be embarrassed if anyone saw?</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been so tired you start doing things that you’d be embarrassed if anyone saw? I must have been sleep walking yesterday morning as I almost put orange juice in my cereal and laundry in the oven! I laughed when I snapped out of it, and knew that was a sign I needed to stop and breathe! Before I ended up doing something less funny, and more irreversibly annoying! Time for a cold cup of tea! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel like you’re always catching up? Like nothing’s ever quite finished and you’re literally in a state of permanently to be continued? My days are blurring into one, I rarely know what date it is, let alone what day of the week it is! I’m no longer frantic, or perplexed by the seemingly never ending chores. I’ve just accepted I can’t do it all, all of the time. Some things just won’t get done right now, and that’s fine. As long as everyone’s fed, we’re winning! No one ever died from a bulging laundry basket, though the size of mine could easily cause extreme palpitations! If dinner’s not made from scratch, pizza it is tonight! And if I don’t get up early enough to give Mary Poppins a run for her money and make a pack lunch for my toddler, the world will still continue revolving and luckily for me we don’t live in no mans land and food can be bought on route. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a Mothers work is never done, there’s literally no point beating yourself up about not doing it all … just do enough, there will always be something that needs to be done, a floor that needs mopping, clothes that need ironing, a nose that needs wiping. Parents tend to put their own needs secondary to that of their children, it goes with the territory and most of us gracefully accept this as a term of parenting. But what if we just decided to put our own needs on par with that of our children? Is that crazy? Or perhaps just slightly below, a kind of one for me two for them scenario. There will always be demands on your time, your energy, your head space, your boobs, but if you choose you and make yourself a priority even for just a fraction of the day you’ll see that your daily commitments still fill the rest of the day, but you get a moment amidst the chaos just for you. You’re worth they moment. Find it, treasure and make it a new habit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday I’ve decided to choose a self care item on my long list of things I’d like to. Today it’s hair braiding, tomorrow I’ll paint my nails… Well at least that’s the plan, and I feel like finding a nice cafe and having a slow uninterrupted cappuccino and cake st some point this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitting a little bit of self care is a challenge most days, my days are non stop and when both kids are sleeping in the evening I’m usually exhausted, staring at an overwhelming pile of laundry that needs sorting and a dishwasher that needs loading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But without that little bit of self care, I have a day full of taking care of everyone but me. And I’ve decided that I deserve to be taken care of too! And it feels good, and yes I’m worth it! So if you’re anything like me and can’t remember the last time you shaved your legs or enjoyed an indulgent bubble bath with essential oils and a glass of Prosecco it may be time for you to join me! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;66 days of me. So the challenge is to do at least one selfish thing a day for 66 days. According to some research carried out by the University College London it takes 66 days to form a habit and this is a habit I want entrenched in my life! So I’m going to make it my new normal to shine a daily dose of self love in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so important to look after our physical, mental and emotional well being. And too often we forget that it takes some effort to do this. Sometimes you’re too burnt out to care or simply don’t have the energy to give you the attention you need. But if you can just claw back a little time and enough energy for yourself, you won’t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self care can come in so many different forms, interpret as you wish. Just do something for yourself that has a positive impact on your physical, mental or emotional wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t juggle all of the balls at the expense of being well rounded and happy. Our children need us to look after ourselves so that we can be the best parents we can be. And we deserve to reflect the love we give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your thoughts and how you exercise self love. Please &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/tinualikor/&#34;&gt;follow&lt;/a&gt;, tag someone who needs to hear this and get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>These words have chimed in my direction a few times.</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;These words have chimed in my direction a few times. What they are likely to actually mean is, it is you and the truth is just too difficult or awkward to recite, so avoidance it is! We’re surrounded by euphemisms and indirect statements that don’t give us the reality we need to hear. I’m all for being gentle and if the white lie protects and restores then perhaps it’s ok for the greater good…for now. But too often little white lies are huge pink elephants in the room and the lies give us a temporary false sense of security and don’t help us to face the issues that we have or that we need to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a situation where the reason being spouted by someone for a decision doesn’t feel genuine? Or someone is treating you in a way that you don’t feel you deserve? Or you’ve reconfigured a story to make it more palatable for your conscious to accept. ‘I was sacked because they don’t like the way I speak to the senior managers.’ Or they didn’t promote me because I’m different’. These could be translated to, ‘I’m often rude and arrogant and have an issue with authority’ or ‘I work in a corporate environment with a strict dress code but I’m embracing my individuality and if I want to show my tattoos and dye my hair blue, then that’s my choice’. Perception is key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes however we find ourselves in unfair situations where we’re surrounded by dream killers and people that want to sabotage our advancement, I call them enemies of progress. An employer who is threatened by your potential, a partner who doesn’t feel adequate and strives to pull you down rather than improve their self esteem to create the balance they long for. It happens, shitty things happen sometimes and we end up in situations that we don’t deserve and find ourselves struggling to understand why. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes….just sometimes It’s us!!!!! We’ve put ourselves in a situation that is detrimental, or we’re behaving in a way that is incompatible with progress, we’re eating too much, drinking too much, procrastinating daily, not getting enough sleep, displaying a foul attitude, flying off the handle, not setting achievable goals, in fact not setting any goals at all, unhappily coasting, going nowhere slowly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have kids they’re a stark reminder of the movement of time. One day you’re embracing a newborn and the next you’re running after a sprightly toddler in what feels like the blink of an eye. Time waits for no one. And in seeing the movement of time you begin to realise how much of it we waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll respond to this dilemma within the context of dating, as I had several experiences that I feel helped me to face my demons. But this issue extends way beyond the dating scene and filters into so many aspects of life. This issue of being in complete denial, burying your head in the sand, hoping that something will change spontaneously, ignoring the red flags in your life, having what I call ostrich syndrome or simply being completely oblivious, sometimes referred to as unintentional blindness. I’ve had it, maybe you have too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched a silly romcom once in my mid twenties that I wish I had seen earlier. Without being melodramatic the premise of the film changed my perception on so many things in my life and helped me to face reality. Not my version of reality, or what I hoped for, but what was actually happening. The film was titled ‘He’s Just Not That Into You’. Have you seen it? Major revelation so late on in life! Following heartbreak, self-loathing, questioning myself, hating the players and the game, asking myself why nothing seemed to be working and why I kept meeting the same ‘types’. Why hadn’t he called, why were our dates so sporadic and irregular? Why didn’t he want to hold my hand? Why don’t I know where he lives? The film helped me to confront bad boy questions like these, and subsequently helped me to apply the same brutal threshold to other areas in my life. If he’s not calling you, he just isn’t that into you…. if they’re not promoting you after 10 years of service, they never will. If you’ve been battling weight issues your whole life and still find yourself stocking up on doughnuts and cheeseburgers, the weight will not just disappear! It’s scary but liberating to finally see the light, acceptance is progress. Reality can be harsh but the real pain comes when you spend years in denial. What’s more painful…plucking out one hair at a time or doing a wax??! Arguably both hurt, both are trying to achieve the same goal, one prolongs the pain as it takes longer, which would you choose? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self assessment is what is saving me. The ability to self reflect and also ask for feedback from those I love and trust. I have more good days than bad days. I sometimes slip into a procrastinating exhausted hole but the hole is shallow and I can still see the light. I try and ask myself difficult questions everyday, some situations take me longer to face head on, but I keep trying, I keep showing up. As part of my Miracle Morning I say the following positive affirmations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am my own super hero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I respect my body and treat it with respect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I accept and love my body as it is and work to make it better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoy the process of reaching a healthy weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am getting stronger and healthier every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I clear away emotional and physical clutter to make room for success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I utilize my time to maximize my success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a woman who effortlessly gets things done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is safe for me to be a woman of success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am beautiful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am in charge of how I feel and today I choose happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing your reality is not easy but it’s possible. First you have to face your reality and decide what you want your reality to be. Join me in making changes and creating your own happy place.  Face your reality or change it.  I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences.

            <description>When people tell me they don’t make plans or set goals I have to do a double take.</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;When people tell me they don’t make plans or set goals I have to do a double take. I’m truly bewildered by the concept of living without direction or measuring your own progress. Goals give you something to dream of, aspire to, work towards. They help you focus your energy and productivity on the areas you choose. They may be scary to some, but they give me purpose and drive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes us so averse to setting goals and preferring to just go with the flow? Nothing wrong with a relaxed approach to life, but having no goals is essentially getting into a car with half a tank of petrol and no destination; you may enjoy the serendipitous journey but you’ll most likely be unprepared and eventually run out of petrol and potentially end up on the hard shoulder of a motorway going to Skegness, up the creek without a paddle as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent situations have reminded me of my mortality and given me the passion to enjoy every day like it was my last. I’m here to encourage you to step out and do something differently today. Challenge yourself to try something you’ve always wanted to, eat a new dish, go to a new park, swim in a new lake, dance to a new tune, travel to a new country. Don’t be bounded by people’s perception of you, what they think you can achieve, what they expect you to do, or even what you’ve conditioned your mind to accept you’re capable of. You are so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everyone told that they can’t&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every exam they said you’d fail that you passed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every dress they said you shouldn’t wear but did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every job they said you’d never get but did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every journey they told you not to take but completed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every man they told you not to be with but happily married&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every apology you deserved but never got&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every battle you fought when no one else would and won&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for all those doubters…may they continue to motivate you to be your best. May you always have your glass half full, living your best life. May you continue to dream freely, and be intentional. Wishing you a limitless life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your dreams, your experiences and your stories no matter how big or small. Please like, share and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/tinualikor/&#34;&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>Last week was mental health awareness week.</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Last week was mental health awareness week. Sadly as a society we seem to have difficulty accepting the diversity of mental illness, and our sensitivities and ignorance have alienated some of the most vulnerable and misunderstood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched a compelling documentary by Louis Theroux called Mothers on the Edge on BBC Two. Depicting an insight into the stories of mothers who found themselves facing mental illness. A fascinating programme which really highlighted the nature of mental illness and it’s indiscriminate, potentially destructive reach. If you haven’t already, it’s worth a gander. It told stories of women who were staying at a residential mental health facility with their babies being treated for various illnesses. Some with a history of mental health concerns and some whose first experience of their illness emerged when their babies were born. It told of women, just like me, living and hoping, working towards a future and through no fault of their own struck with sometimes unexplainable mental illnesses. It humbled me to think that this so easily could have been me. Mental illness doesn’t discriminate, it transcends class, wealth, social position, employment history, and notions of ‘strength’. When people speak of women on the edge I slightly recoil as I feel we’re all living on the edge of something… and sometimes the smallest and seemingly insignificant catalyst can push any of us over the edge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motherhood as I’ve documented in my blogs has been an experience I will treasure forever. It’s been beautiful and rewarding, and yet the hardest journey I’ve ever encountered and whilst I’ve never experienced mental illness I could identify with some of the emotions the women claimed to be feeling. Helplessness, anxiety, exhaustion to name a few. I saw myself in some of them and wondered what pushed them to the edge? Most of these feelings I guess are just part and parcel of motherhood… but when these emotions begin to overwhelm you and you literally feel like you’re drowning, it’s time to ask for help. At what point should you ask for help…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now…the time is now, it’s never too early to speak and be heard, to share your thoughts, your fears, the confusion that envelopes you, the debilitating anxiety that grips you. You’re not alone. I’ll be honest and say that the documentary made me tear up. When I thought about these women facing their demons, struggling in their daily lives, suffocated by their thoughts, I felt sad. Sad not only because of the compassion I felt and the poignance of the relationship between a mother and child, and the daily challenges, but because that could so easily have been me, or one of my loved ones… and I’m not sure I’d recognise the signs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in social media perfection, striving to show our best, put our best foot forward and ensure we keep it together at all costs, and when we can’t, insta doesn’t send help… facebook doesn’t give you a warm embrace and twitter certainly doesn’t wipe away your tears. And yet we continue to expect mothers to have it all ticking along, because Grandma had 8 kids and could balance 3 of them on her hip whilst ploughing the field. Grandma was awesome. Props to her! I on the other hand hate gardening and can barely balance one kid on my hip. I have it as all together as I can, regularly questioning my ability to keep all my balls in the air, and even more regularly deciding to put the balls down and just have a nap. I try, like we all do and have moments of vulnerability, despondence and darkness, sometimes no amount of self motivation will do, and we just need some help. So as we come to the end of Mental Health Awareness week, I implore you to consider the mothers who may need a little extra kindness, patience, compassion and a non judgmental ear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself on the edge I hope you remember there are so many of us right next to you. Don’t look down and lose your balance, step away from the rim and keep your feet firmly on the ground. I hope you find a source of help and support, and get back to your happy place. &lt;/p&gt;

            <description>Living in a country where English is the secondary or even third language has its ups and downs.</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Living in a country where English is the secondary or even third language has its ups and downs. We are physically immersed in a language we have little comprehension of. Thankfully, our intuition is often strong, we’re able to muddle our way through most situations., and thankfully we seem to have the seventh sense, “get your arse out of here”, or “go ask someone you pillock before you end up requesting for bail”. Today has been one of those days that highlights just how lost in translation we are here in Switzerland! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to the Accident and Emergency on the only day that suits our setup! No support means illnesses need to be scheduled on appropriate days where both parents are available, so the sick parent can be relieved of duties temporarily to seek repair, heaven forbid we’re both sick at the same time, if man flu is a contender, I lose….cue eye roll…so today is apparently a national holiday here in Switzerland. Perfect for me to get myself seen by a doctor. Enroute we’re waiting at a tram stop and no trams are showing up, but the electronic display is indicating there’ll be one along in 8 minutes….10 minutes later nothing….this is so unswiss, you could almost set your clock using the transport schedule as they’re usually so punctual!! ….but there’s no sign anywhere, I’ve made that mistake before, sitting at an out of service bus stop behind a large bright orange sign in German saying out of service….so I’m not making that mistake again!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope this time it’s different, something’s going on….but no clue what!! Intuition and a large dose of impatience means we’re never caught out for long in a situation like this, but it’s oh so frustrating when apparently there’s a demonstration which has closed off the city centre, so we need to abort our plan and find another doctor! I bet that’s what all those annoying announcements were blaring out on the way! Typical….no bloody idea! I know a little high German, and that gets me by mostly. And I’ve considered getting private lessons but Swiss German is spoken out here and you can only really learn that on the streets…and it’s nothing like high German&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often ask me why we moved, are we home sick, what is it like living in a different country, do we consider it home yet? My answers to these questions often vary depending on who’s asking, why, and what time of the day I’m approached, but for the most part we are adventurers. We love exploring, travelling, learning and expanding our horizons and know that the world has so much to offer if we just open our eyes, and step out of our comfort zone. Adventures are stories that we can’t predict, they’re exciting, scary, risky, fun and open doors that we never thought we had access to and in that vein create the art of the possible. Possibilities create hope, they fuel passion and ignite a zeal that no one can quench. We live by the mantra that you only live once, and you should grasp opportunities with both hands and run. Opportunities don’t always approach you, waving and beckoning, opportunities also need to be created. Create opportunities and make things happen, say yes more, and do things that excite you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adventures don’t last forever, things change, life happens, and we ride the waves and keep it moving. We all need to pause sometimes, take stock, change direction, re-evaluate where we are and where we’re trying to get to. We win some, we lose, and that’s ok. it’s ok to pause,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set ourselves apart from the crowd by choosing courage over comfort, love over solitude. Our risks don’t always pay off, but that doesn’t matter, we keep trying, keep hustling, keep showing up. We love the thrill of the journey, the memories we create, the lessons learnt, the history created. We wouldn’t trade it for a stable paycheck or loyalty points. Stability suits most but our priority is to live, and sometimes these two components are incompatible. Our foundation is strong so a few branches pruned and splintered along the way is fine. Keep your core strong, lean into possibilities, and block out all the noise. It’s in blocking out the noise of the concrete jungle that you’ll truly begin to understand that we are all one, sometimes no need to even translate, just be. Be you.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I’m not great at following trends! I’d like to think I’m individual and try not to get swept away with fads and to be honest I’m about as ‘on trend’ as John McCririck or a stale Jaffa cake. Now I’m 35 I care less what people think, I wear what I like , rarely wear make up and generally enjoying the not giving a damn phase. Spending time with my family, sharing, loving, connecting rather than succumbing to the narcism that is gripping the world. I do however love to get dressed up when I have the opportunity and in remembrance of my party days, dancing on bars, crowd surfing (I never managed to pull that off successfully) falling into taxis, falling out of ubers and generally making magical hungover memories I’d like to master something I’ve never got the hang of. Lippy!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had the confidence or inclination to wear it, but recently on my journey to improving my confidence and getting involved with self care, I have admired so many who wear lippy with pride! It’s amazing how it can change your entire look and elevate you from casual to ‘oh hello’ in a few pouts! But it does take some confidence to wear it and that’s what I’m working on! Whilst I’m working on my groove, in tandem I need to find decent lippy to try and would love to see you with your favourite lippy on to give me some inspiration! So join me please and  #getlippy2019. Just post a picture of yourself with the hashtags #getlippy2019 and tell me what lippy you’ve got!! I can’t wait to see them all, share with others, the more the merrier! &lt;/p&gt;

            <description>Now I’ve got your attention… did you think I actually had tips…does anyone?</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve got your attention… did you think I actually had tips…does anyone?! I remember before my daughter was born jokingly but seriously asking people with multiple kids for tips on how to cope with two kids….no one responded. At first I thought, that’s just rude really…a girl just needs some advice, and now I realise that everyone is full on blagging their way through parenthood and no one can offer any tips because some of their survival techniques are unconventional or tailor made to suit them, or they’re simply just surviving!! Whatever your ‘methods’ I salute and chest bump you with passion.  It ain’t easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well…. I am three months into having two children, just when I thought I had got the shower routine mastered, got my hair out of doo doo plaits and ditched the stained hareem pants, I go and have another child! This new addition was never going to propel me into more self loving and uninterrupted ‘me time’. I now have even less time, am even more exhausted… if that’s even possible and actually considered sitting in my double pram whilst the toddler was at nursery, pulling the hood down and having a kip next to the baby the other day… I was that tired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I have no real tips as such there are a few things that I wish I had known and that have helped me ‘survive’ so far. So I’m sharing in the hope that even one parent out there receives some light and love from this post, even if it is just a warm virtual bear hug reminding you, you’re not alone! We’re all just fumbling around in the dark hoping not to cause any irreparable damage! And we are essentially doing great, we just need reminding of that occasionally! Please share things that work for you too! Every little helps!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here it is, my top ten suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a baby carrier - I never used one with my first child. I never really needed to! I had the luxury of not having to regularly multi task whilst holding my son, so although I had one only used it a handful of occasions. When you have more than one child, a baby carrier is like air! Fundamental!!! You’ll need your hands free to do stuff, tend to your other child, household stuff, whatever, but in those early stages casually sitting breastfeeding or cuddling your newborn for hours isn’t always possible. Look for your nearest sling library and try before you buy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a decent bag. Notice I didn’t say baby bag. If you find a fit for purpose baby bag that works for you then run with it, but you really need a bag that’s big enough for what you need, accessible, and can be attached or hung on your pushchair with ease. If you buy a large bag you can purchase inserts for each child to differentiate between their things, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always carry a water bottle and food (not just for the kids!) - rehydrate and feed yourself too!! Whether you’re breastfeeding or not, a fuelled mummy is a happier mummy. Water is essential especially when breastfeeding. I remember getting headaches in the first few weeks of my daughters birth when I was dehydrated. Easy resolution! Drink!! And I don’t mean cocktails! As for eating, I had a habit of just eating in between meals, eating my sons left over food and sometimes being too tired to have my own meal once the kids are sleeping. This isn’t sustainable and you need to make sure you’re looking after yourself. So batch cook if it’s easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to ask for help. My husband and I have always done everything ourselves due to geography, which has put a strain on us both as we seldom get time out. But now we have 2 children we actively welcome opportunities to get help and in the first 2 months of my daughters life I received help with my toddler to ensure he was stimulated daily, happy and engaged. Asking for help from your loved ones is not a sign of weakness or inability to cope. It really does take a village to raise a child. Put your village on speed dial and get them involved!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do your best to schedule your kids naps as close together as possible. Nap time is sacred. My son no longer naps. I know, I cried about it too, but if he did I would be taking this on board! Try and be consistent with bedtime too. Children love routine and once they know what to expect you’ll have an easier time getting them to comply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find distraction techniques for the older child. Have quick go-to toys and games that your child loves to keep him/her occupied if you need to attend to the younger one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get out of the house! Yes I know it sounds like a logistical nightmare and it can be the first couple of times when you work out what works for you, and literally ‘how’ to get you all clothed and fed to leave the house! But… once you get past the chaos, it will feel like you’ve reached nirvana! The fresh air and change of scenery will do wonders for your mental health and the children will feel better too!

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep when they sleep. If you manage to get both kids sleeping simultaneously….grab your duvet and get involved! The washing, cooking, laundry, phonecall, can wait!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Date night. In-between feeds, nappy changes, projectile vomit, nursery runs and reruns of paw patrol remember how it all began and make some time for the love that started it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make time for yourself at least once a week. Even if it’s just half an hour of uninterruption. Do something you enjoy! Read a book, paint your nails, have a hot bath, go to the cinema, go for a swim. Whatever floats your boat, make time for it. You will always have lots to do, the list is endless, but if you make time for the things that are important to you and make them a priority rather than a ‘nice to have’ the rest of your time will be filled with the daily responsibilities and you’ll feel better for the little moments you made time for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

            <description>1. Believe in yourself You need to be your own cheerleader.</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-believe-in-yourself&#34;&gt;1. Believe in yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to be your own cheerleader. Focus on the things you’re great at. Trust your own abilities. Remember the things you have achieved so far and use those memories as a foundation for the things you’d like to achieve in the future. Don’t be afraid to be heard. Your opinion is valuable and counts &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-silence-your-inner-critic&#34;&gt;2. Silence your inner critic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self deprecation needs to stop. When someone says you look great, say thank you. When someone congratulates you on a good job, again say thank you. Sometimes to silence the inner critic you need positive voices around you shouting louder! If you have no friends to reinforce Your good qualities and give you positive constructive feedback, then listen to energising talks, podcasts, videos, audio books, fill your spirit with so much positivity that the niggling inner critic will soon be drowned out… and reconsider your friendship circle! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-follow-through-with-what-you-say-you-will-do&#34;&gt;3. Follow through with what you say you will do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop procrastinating. Under promise and over deliver at first if you have to. But whatever you do, follow through. Differentiate between reasons and excuses. The more you get stuff done the more credible you will feel. It’s really as simple as that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-educate-yourself-stay-current&#34;&gt;4. Educate yourself - stay current.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge really is power and the more information you have the less you’ll feel like an imposter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-visualise-your-goals&#34;&gt;5. Visualise your goals &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create mind maps and mood boards. Someone once said to me ‘if you can see it you can have it’. Visualising your goals will make them more tangible, and on your road to a more confident you, make your vision of yourself a reality, but paint the picture first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-dress-to-impress-yourself&#34;&gt;6. Dress to impress yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason when you look good you feel good. When you put on your best you feel like you’re on the road to world domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-monitor-your-progress&#34;&gt;7. Monitor your progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence grows with progress, it’s really as simple as that. If you monitor your progress you can see just how far you’ve come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-be-shameless-and-stay-in-your-lane&#34;&gt;8. Be shameless and stay in your lane&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think less about what people think. Most people don’t have their ish together and are just faking it until they make it. Don’t worry about what others are doing or not doing! Don’t use other people as your benchmark for success. Just be you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-take-risks&#34;&gt;9. Take risks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk takers are history makers. Heard of the saying he who dares wins? Risks are not for the faint hearted but to really grow in confidence you have to do things that scare you, and in stepping out of your comfort zone, you’re winning already. It takes confidence to take risks and be bold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;10-do-more-of-what-makes-you-happy-and-you-re-good-at&#34;&gt;10. Do more of what makes you happy and you’re good at&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence is reinforced by joy. Be happy and confidence will exude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, please feel free to get in touch. I’ll be posting a new blog every Monday morning. You can follow me using the links on my site. Have a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>I saw a post the other day that made me laugh…</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I saw a post the other day that made me laugh…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“None of this new year new me bollocks, last year I was fabulous and next year I will be fabulous!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very amusing, and vaguely relevant to me, I’m fabulous some days, possibly two days a week, but honestly, I think it’s BS. Maybe not a new me, but a better version of myself wouldn’t hurt, perhaps like a software update! I don’t want to put myself under any undue pressure….believe me, I’m already precariously balancing several bits of Swedish china at once, but without any pressure how do you move forward? Improvement is growth and staying fabulous takes a bit of work! I just need to find the right amount of pressure that’ll kick me out of bed to get stuff done but won’t leave me feeling like the soggy lettuce I found in my fridge this morning, if I drop the ball sometimes. I haven’t made any new years resolutions because I have genuinely been overwhelmed with ‘stuff’, to do lists, trello boards, survival lists, breastfeeding, laundry, nursery runs, cooking, cleaning, answering my 2 year olds repeated questions on underground trains and if mummy is having another baby? And did I say laundry already?! Laundry is a full time occupation in itself with a newborn and toddler! The washer and dryer are regularly abused by us, my husband is the family expert on this, I have more of a fly by the seat of your pants approach semi conscious and bundling heaves of milk and mud stained items of clothing in for saving… long live the washer and dryer….if anyone’s deliberating, separate washer and dryer gets a thumbs up from me if you have the space it’ll change your life! Middle aged confessions of a mum… No need for resolutions, just live, set goals achievable and stretching, and ambitious if you feel the urge, and be kind to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind there’s so much I want to do, but I really need to ace the basic getting the kids ready in under 2 hours and maintain my demeanour routine before I start trying to conquer the world! Or do I? I mean what am I really waiting for? Waiting for perfection before I take on something I’m passionate about sounds counterintuitive, or like a well versed delay tactic…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So….in pursuit of happiness and progress, not a tick boxing exercise or a fake fad or an overzealous binge diet, I am starting a new project! I am continuing my blog once a week channelling my thoughts and sharing my journey and soon I’ll be recording a podcast. Returning to a former passion I had the pleasure of finding in my teens with BBC Radio 4 when I recorded programmes and audio diaries. I’m looking forward to learning how to record, it feels like a natural progression from blogging, I’m in the process of researching, getting the right equipment and creating my structure and format. I have a few ideas I’m excited about and looking forward to putting it in to action. Watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know I’ve been living in Switzerland with my husband and now two children. Housewife with the mostess… parenting like a supply teacher who should consider retiring. Finding my way through local culture, far from where I call home and the people I love, starting a new chapter in the land of cheese, orgasmic chocolate and fancy watches. The biggest change for me has been getting used to what being a housewife means. Or perhaps defining what we &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; my role to be and what we &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; my role to be, and getting it to fit with my passions and my desired direction. I’m jack of all trades, master of most. Like most parents I can’t have a day off, I don’t get sick leave. I don’t have it all together, and running seamlessly….but I do have the drive and passion that fuels my exhausted body to teach myself how to make meat pies for my 2 year old at 1am because we can’t get them out here… Yes I did that last night… so basically Beyonce is right &lt;strong&gt;we run the world!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second project this year will be something that’s close to my heart. Married to a techie, I’ve grown to love tech more and realise just how much it influences our daily lives. I’m motivated enough to function on minimal sleep and love technology, but most of all I love people and getting the best out of them. And I’ve had the pleasure of meeting awesome women out here, some who just like me followed their spouse across water, land, or just a car park to pursue a dream. Fully supporting the husbands career and building a home often means that some women are unable to fulfill their own goals and realise their own passions. Coupled with a system here that encourages women to stay at home, getting back to work after having a baby or just being a homemaking spouse can sometimes be a tall order, and even taller for us foreign folk, the expat crew. So I’m setting up a coding school called Tech Mums with childcare here in Zurich, Switzerland!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech Mums will be a place where mums can learn a new skill, invest in their career, network with like minded parents and professionals, socialise, update their skillset&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and get back to work if they choose! I had the pleasure of being a part of a similar initiative in London called Mums in Technology, and found it to be invaluable, supportive and groundbreaking. I am excited to be starting a project that inspires me to get more women in technology here in Switzerland! Lean into the sisterhood and stay fabulous…I want to inspire and be inspired. To create a welcoming, nurturing environment where mums can come and be themselves, gain a friend, gain a hobby, gain a skill and get the tools they need to kick some arse into a career they can thrive in…let’s go!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>I gave birth to my daughter not so long ago…and my life changed.</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I gave birth to my daughter not so long ago…and my life changed. All of a sudden I feel the need to be the woman my daughter will respect and look up to. A woman of integrity and good standing. A woman she’d be proud to call her mum. I didn’t quite feel the same when I had my son. Yes, I felt the basic maternal pull of wanting to be a good role model and parent, and keep him happy and create a nurturing loving environment for him. But this awareness of my daughter, a woman in the making, in a world where we have fought for equality tirelessly and still argue over the gender pay gap and general sexism, I fear that I have brought her into a world that won’t give her the chance she deserves. But I want to teach her to take what she deserves and throw away the notion that you get what you’re given and to wait politely for your turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to equip her with the tools to make the best of every situation. To thrive even in arid conditions. To be a lover not a hater. I want her to be resilient, strong, feisty, unrepentant in truth, strong willed and vivacious. To be herself, authentic, unapologetic, fierce and loving. To see her unairbrushed, undiluted beauty. I want her to feel entitled to success, to belong if she chooses, to banish any emotions of imposition, to set her own standards, dance to her own beat and to enjoy every moment as if it were her last. I need to lead by example…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 is moments away…a new year, full of new opportunities, new hope, new challenges, new adventures. I’m excited, and apprehensive and eager to embark on a new chapter. I’ve been a stay at home mother for almost three years. Enjoying the fruit of nurturing the growth of my children and balancing my need for personal satisfaction with my responsibilities as a mother and wife. I’m enjoying this stage in my life and preparing for my next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going into this year putting the pains and mistakes of 2018 behind me, learning as I go. Allowing doors that need to be closed to stay firmly shut, looking forward to new doors being open. Finding new zeal and passion for progress, and making me a priority. Grateful for loyal friends whose love is without condition. Looking forward to continuing raising my children in love and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, may you find joy, and may your dreams find you. May you be the change you want to see. May you find peace in your decisions. May you find vision helpers and people who truly have your back. May your husband replace the toilet roll occasionally, and take the rubbish out without complaining. May your boobs recover from breastfeeding and may postpartum hair loss be a myth, may you get some precious sleep without being shocked awake with a chubby finger in your nostril. May your glass of prosecco always runneth over. May you find the strength to make the changes you need and the resilience to plan without fear of failure. And mostly may you remember just how wonderful you are and have the potential to be, and simply be thankful for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t create your life first and then live it. You create it by living it not agonising over it! Whatever your situation be the best version of yourself! May this year be a year of doing, and living. Happy New Year! Be intentional…&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>When I was 8 if you had asked me what I want to be when I grow up my answers were as colourful as my prized Care Bear lunch box…pilot, lawyer, doctor, painter, architect, ballerina, astronaut, UN leader, journalist, news reader, butcher, baker, candlestick maker…and I truly believed I could be any one of those on any given day, and perhaps moonlight in one I was less keen on in the evenings!</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;When I was 8 if you had asked me what I want to be when I grow up my answers were as colourful as my prized Care Bear lunch box…pilot, lawyer, doctor, painter, architect, ballerina, astronaut, UN leader, journalist, news reader, butcher, baker, candlestick maker…and I truly believed I could be any one of those on any given day, and perhaps moonlight in one I was less keen on in the evenings! Cute? Ambitious much?! Or even perhaps ridiculous? Like most children I was a dreamer, with boundless priceless possibilities in my mind. Innocent desire that had no limitations. That had no concept of can’t, no glass ceilings, or iron doors, or gender pay gaps or concept of discrimination, or insecurities. Just dreams. Dreams that I loved to picture, that gave me drive, motivated me to do my homework, gave me a goal, a purpose and a passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m in my 30s I’m not sure I have space for my dreams right now. Time to dream, or the energy to pursue them. But I need to make space. Space to imagine the impossible, to conjure up paths full of adventure, of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one who’s shelved my dreams? The only one who’s decided dreaming is for kids, adults don’t dream, they get real. Life is real, and when the reality of its fabric hits you, the dreamer fairytale is squashed. What a travesty! What’s the point of living if you can’t dream? What happened to that gooey feeling when you think of all the possibilities and hopes? What happened to the energy you felt when someone asked you what you wanted to be when you grew up? Just because you didn’t make it to the Bar or aren’t a famous West End dancer, that doesn’t mean you should stop dreaming. A dream changed is not a dream lost. We can just pivot…can’t we… aim for the moon and hit the stars…aim for something…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we stop trying to fulfil our dreams? Fear of not living up to those dreams? When did dreams get old? Maybe in adulthood we rename dreams ‘goals’? Maybe it’s easier to comprehend. When did we start trying to apply the SMART criteria to dreams? Specific, measurable, achievable, results-focused, and time- bound! Don’t confine your dreams to principles. Dreams are glorious, and big and seemingly unachievable, and uplifting and scary. We need them! They keep us alive, motivated , focused and inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine Charlotte Philby has just announced completion of one of her life’s dreams! A spy novel she’s been working on! What an achievement! What a feeling to have started and finished! To have accomplished and reached the peak of one of your wild imaginations! Awesome and inspiring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going back to the drawing board of dreams and writing up new ones and rehashing old post-its that have been relegated to a notebook I bought in 1991. I’m bringing back dreams! They push me out of my comfort zone. Big dreams are like big knickers, we all need them even if we don’t admit it! I’m not ashamed of my big knickers, I’m not ashamed of my dreams. One day I’ll be sharing completion of my big dreams too and celebrating even the small wins with glee! If your dreams don’t scare you they’re not big enough!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share your dreams with those you love. Once you vocalise them they become tangible and possible. Dreams can change and evolve, but don’t crush your dreams or let others. Don’t give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t create your life first and then live it. You create it by living it! Not agonising over it. Try letting go of perfection today and dream! Dream because you deserve to be free to think the impossible. Because dreamers are doers. Because sometimes we’re surrounded by walls and restrictions, and dreams elevate us into a beautiful realm of possibilities. Let go of perfect and dream. I’d love to hear your dreams!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>We moved to Switzerland just over a year ago.</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We moved to Switzerland just over a year ago. It’s been a roller coaster of adjustments, tested the strength of our marriage and my love for fried chicken, or should I say the absence of good chicken. We had discussed moving abroad a little, considered where we’d like to try and my husband joyfully reminisced about a previous experience he had in Switzerland a few years back. I had never been, or heard much about it. It wasn’t on my bucket list of countries to visit, I’m not a big chocolate fan and my interest in cheese is variable. But move here we did, to the beauty that is Zurich, following some research and a passion to try something new, live unapologetically and say yes more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband is like a used sales man who could sell a written off fiat punto as a limited edition collectors item. Not that I’m likening Zurich to a clapped out motor… more like high spec Range. So I was sold… changed my work contract to give me supplementary leave, sorted out all my boring admin and packed up our flat and crammed what I could in suitcases, storage and the rest just got trashed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarily final, we arrived in a country I’d never even visited weeks after having surgery on my leg. I was still on crutches and struggled to push the pram and walk at the same time. But somehow I did. Physio at its best! We stayed in temporary accommodation for months! Small bedsit type apartments that I thought were better suited to a bachelor on a stag than a family of 3 attempting to set up home…note to self, ‘do not leave husband in charge of booking accommodation’. We applied for permanent apartments in the notoriously competitive Swiss housing market and were rejected countless times. Our housing applications read like arse kissing resumes, frustratingly detailed and intrusive, and yet still not good enough….blood anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After months of sleeping on broken beds, showering with flip flops on and cooking pasta in someone else’s pot above my sons travel cot, I’d had enough. Having no fixed abode was not only stressful because of the size and lack of amenities, having an active toddler rattling around in a non baby friendly apartment hitting his head on every sharp edge available was eye watering. I couldn’t register for anything as we had no fixed abode, I was in nomadic limbo. I told my husband I was going home until we found somewhere to live that had a bath I could bathe our son in, and four hobs on the stove, and a freezer…yes I am that girl….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Home is wherever you hang your hat baby’….’as long as we’re together we’ll be happy’…”save your lyrics for R Kelly, call me when we’ve got somewhere to live babe….and I love you too”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I took my son back to London, gratefully returned to our bath and four hobs, and kept on the search for somewhere permanent in Switzerland. I did viewings via Facetime whilst my husband sauntered around the empty apartments showing me the layout, pretentiously wearing a suit to portray the ‘right image’… cue eye roll. Months later we were successful and finally got a break! We signed the contract and were given the keys to our first home in Switzerland! It didn’t tick all of my boxes but compromise is a large pill that must be swallowed fast when your options are limited!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a place to call home. Relieved and settled, I can now start to make connections with people and I have found my son a nursery and local activities. It’s taken us a year of blood sweat and tears, but we did it. There were times I wanted to give up. I questioned our assessment of the pros and cons and just wanted to be able to find my hair straighteners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;&#34;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switzerland is a beautiful country, designed for efficiency, and ideal for young families. It’s charm lies in exploring its breathtaking postcard landscapes and relaxed bubble of safety. The Swiss are reserved, non-confrontational and polite, and yet display an air of frost that ensures that after pleasant introductions you keep your distance. If you’re young free and single I think there are more exciting places to savour, and if you hate recycling I’d give it a wide berth! I have never spent so much time contemplating what to do with rubbish! And my cardboard folding skills are still not up to scratch. Yes they expect you to fold cardboard and tie it neatly in piles for collection on specific days….are you still awake!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expat community is large and welcoming, and embraces new comers with enthusiasm, helpful suggestions and friendly recommendations. Switzerland lives on Facebook groups and old barely functional websites. So if you’re craving taramasalata at 2am or need an acupuncturist with a clinic overlooking the lake, someone somewhere will kindly point you in the right direction! My husband enjoys his job and my son loves it here, now I just need to find my place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving here has meant I’ve not been able to work, I’ve put my career on hold to raise our family and get us settled. I’ve been fiercely independent my whole life, the concept of being a housewife despite having a role made me question my worth, and left me feeling vulnerable and itching to do something. Is that what I really want to do? Is it a means to an end? Can I raise a family and still have a thriving career? How do I balance work and childcare? Can i return to my job? The hours were long, travel commitments can be unfavourable and will I be able to afford to work and pay for childcare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motherhood often forces you to reassess your choices, your career path and your dreams. Flexible working is no longer a buzz term, it’s something I really need to find, and make it work for me. It’s ok to want to fulfill your dreams and it’s ok to not know where to even begin. But it’s not ok to be riddled with regret and ‘what ifs’. I encourage you to join me in daring to dream, and live your life to it’s fullest potential. Live the best life for you…you are unique and beautiful for your situation. I’m looking for my passion, taking opportunities that arise and simply saying yes! Yes is where the adventure begins!&lt;/p&gt;
