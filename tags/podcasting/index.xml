      <description>I saw a post the other day that made me laugh…
“None of this new year new me bollocks, last year I was fabulous and next year I will be fabulous!”
Very amusing, and vaguely relevant to me, I’m fabulous some days, possibly two days a week, but honestly, I think it’s BS. Maybe not a new me, but a better version of myself wouldn’t hurt, perhaps like a software update!</description>
