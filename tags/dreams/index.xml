            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;When people tell me they don’t make plans or set goals I have to do a double take. I’m truly bewildered by the concept of living without direction or measuring your own progress. Goals give you something to dream of, aspire to, work towards. They help you focus your energy and productivity on the areas you choose. They may be scary to some, but they give me purpose and drive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes us so averse to setting goals and preferring to just go with the flow? Nothing wrong with a relaxed approach to life, but having no goals is essentially getting into a car with half a tank of petrol and no destination; you may enjoy the serendipitous journey but you’ll most likely be unprepared and eventually run out of petrol and potentially end up on the hard shoulder of a motorway going to Skegness, up the creek without a paddle as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent situations have reminded me of my mortality and given me the passion to enjoy every day like it was my last. I’m here to encourage you to step out and do something differently today. Challenge yourself to try something you’ve always wanted to, eat a new dish, go to a new park, swim in a new lake, dance to a new tune, travel to a new country. Don’t be bounded by people’s perception of you, what they think you can achieve, what they expect you to do, or even what you’ve conditioned your mind to accept you’re capable of. You are so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everyone told that they can’t&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every exam they said you’d fail that you passed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every dress they said you shouldn’t wear but did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every job they said you’d never get but did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every journey they told you not to take but completed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every man they told you not to be with but happily married&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every apology you deserved but never got&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every battle you fought when no one else would and won&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for all those doubters…may they continue to motivate you to be your best. May you always have your glass half full, living your best life. May you continue to dream freely, and be intentional. Wishing you a limitless life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your dreams, your experiences and your stories no matter how big or small. Please like, share and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/tinualikor/&#34;&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>When I was 8 if you had asked me what I want to be when I grow up my answers were as colourful as my prized Care Bear lunch box…pilot, lawyer, doctor, painter, architect, ballerina, astronaut, UN leader, journalist, news reader, butcher, baker, candlestick maker…and I truly believed I could be any one of those on any given day, and perhaps moonlight in one I was less keen on in the evenings!</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;When I was 8 if you had asked me what I want to be when I grow up my answers were as colourful as my prized Care Bear lunch box…pilot, lawyer, doctor, painter, architect, ballerina, astronaut, UN leader, journalist, news reader, butcher, baker, candlestick maker…and I truly believed I could be any one of those on any given day, and perhaps moonlight in one I was less keen on in the evenings! Cute? Ambitious much?! Or even perhaps ridiculous? Like most children I was a dreamer, with boundless priceless possibilities in my mind. Innocent desire that had no limitations. That had no concept of can’t, no glass ceilings, or iron doors, or gender pay gaps or concept of discrimination, or insecurities. Just dreams. Dreams that I loved to picture, that gave me drive, motivated me to do my homework, gave me a goal, a purpose and a passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m in my 30s I’m not sure I have space for my dreams right now. Time to dream, or the energy to pursue them. But I need to make space. Space to imagine the impossible, to conjure up paths full of adventure, of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one who’s shelved my dreams? The only one who’s decided dreaming is for kids, adults don’t dream, they get real. Life is real, and when the reality of its fabric hits you, the dreamer fairytale is squashed. What a travesty! What’s the point of living if you can’t dream? What happened to that gooey feeling when you think of all the possibilities and hopes? What happened to the energy you felt when someone asked you what you wanted to be when you grew up? Just because you didn’t make it to the Bar or aren’t a famous West End dancer, that doesn’t mean you should stop dreaming. A dream changed is not a dream lost. We can just pivot…can’t we… aim for the moon and hit the stars…aim for something…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we stop trying to fulfil our dreams? Fear of not living up to those dreams? When did dreams get old? Maybe in adulthood we rename dreams ‘goals’? Maybe it’s easier to comprehend. When did we start trying to apply the SMART criteria to dreams? Specific, measurable, achievable, results-focused, and time- bound! Don’t confine your dreams to principles. Dreams are glorious, and big and seemingly unachievable, and uplifting and scary. We need them! They keep us alive, motivated , focused and inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine Charlotte Philby has just announced completion of one of her life’s dreams! A spy novel she’s been working on! What an achievement! What a feeling to have started and finished! To have accomplished and reached the peak of one of your wild imaginations! Awesome and inspiring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going back to the drawing board of dreams and writing up new ones and rehashing old post-its that have been relegated to a notebook I bought in 1991. I’m bringing back dreams! They push me out of my comfort zone. Big dreams are like big knickers, we all need them even if we don’t admit it! I’m not ashamed of my big knickers, I’m not ashamed of my dreams. One day I’ll be sharing completion of my big dreams too and celebrating even the small wins with glee! If your dreams don’t scare you they’re not big enough!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share your dreams with those you love. Once you vocalise them they become tangible and possible. Dreams can change and evolve, but don’t crush your dreams or let others. Don’t give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t create your life first and then live it. You create it by living it! Not agonising over it. Try letting go of perfection today and dream! Dream because you deserve to be free to think the impossible. Because dreamers are doers. Because sometimes we’re surrounded by walls and restrictions, and dreams elevate us into a beautiful realm of possibilities. Let go of perfect and dream. I’d love to hear your dreams!&lt;/p&gt;
