      <description>Hey how are you?
I&amp;rsquo;m good, how are you?
It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to give these knee jerk responses to a casual question we hear daily. And I&amp;rsquo;m by no means suggesting an episode of verbal diarrhoea with boundless content every time someone asks how you are at the supermarket checkout! That would be weird! But when you&amp;rsquo;re in a safe place…and if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a safe place, get one! A safe place, where you can be yourself, a person whom you trust.</description>

      <description>Growing up without a father I always wondered what happened between my parents. In my naivety and innocence I questioned what part I had played in my father leaving before I was 3, and what I could have done to get him to stay.
 At 16 I went in search for a father who had not responded to any of my phone calls or letters. Who had never contacted me on my birthday or even when he was told I had been undergoing a series of potentially life threatening surgeries.</description>
