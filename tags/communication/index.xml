      <description>Hey how are you?
I&amp;rsquo;m good, how are you?
It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to give these knee jerk responses to a casual question we hear daily. And I&amp;rsquo;m by no means suggesting an episode of verbal diarrhoea with boundless content every time someone asks how you are at the supermarket checkout! That would be weird! But when you&amp;rsquo;re in a safe place…and if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a safe place, get one! A safe place, where you can be yourself, a person whom you trust.</description>

      <description>Have you heard of the term Hangry? It’s a clever portmanteau of hungry and angry, and an adjective that describes being irritable due to hunger, a term to describe that feeling you get when you’re hungry, and about to knock someone the hell out if you don’t get some food fast!
Well I’ve felt like that often, so I’m known for carrying around snacks and planning my life around where the nearest eatery is.</description>
