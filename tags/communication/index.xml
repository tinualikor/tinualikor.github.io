            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[<p><strong>Hey how are you?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m good, how are you?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to give these knee jerk responses to a casual question we hear daily. And I&rsquo;m by no means suggesting an episode of verbal diarrhoea with boundless content every time someone asks how you are at the supermarket checkout! That would be weird! But when you&rsquo;re in a safe place…and if you don&rsquo;t have a safe place, get one! A safe place, where you can be yourself, a person whom you trust. A real answer is just what the doctor ordered. Honesty breeds healing and progress and gives light to those dark areas in our lives.</p>

<p><strong>Hey how are you?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m exhausted, hungry, fed up, disappointed, lonely, depressed and anxious. I got a parking ticket yesterday, I&rsquo;ve got this lingering toothache. I haven&rsquo;t had a shower in two days. The laundry hasn&rsquo;t been done, I&rsquo;ve run out of detergent and milk but forgot to get some in the last shopping trip, so no tea for me today, I can&rsquo;t be dealing with black tea. My job is thankless and monotonous, and my boss hates me. The kids have given me a cold, so now my nose is streaming and as if I&rsquo;m not already sleep deprived enough I&rsquo;m coughing like a chain smoker on helium at night, wheezing and breathless. I&rsquo;m overdrawn on my overdraft, dealing with family conflict, and I think my wife is having an affair. with her personal trainer. We&rsquo;ve been secretly doing IVF and the pressure of the failed cycles is mounting, I&rsquo;m not sure our relationship can endure this battering. We have one last attempt left.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m having a bad hair week, this afro is about to get another big chop if it ain&rsquo;t careful, and I&rsquo;ve gained about 50 pounds in the last month. I need to book a GP appt for myself, I&rsquo;ve had this persistent problem and I need a solution not a placebo… but I&rsquo;m hoping it will just go away if I leave it long enough&hellip;</p>

<p>I woke up this morning and it took me longer than normal to convince myself to face the world. Everyday it seems to be getting more difficult. I&rsquo;ve called in sick a few times at work, but I can&rsquo;t pull a sicky on life. But my response as always if you care to ask is… I&rsquo;m fine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you can relate to any of this, but whatever your challenges and hurdles, whatever is keeping you up at night. It&rsquo;s ok not to be ok. </p>

<p>I see you holding everyone up, holding it all together. Trying to be solid like an ox. Putting on a brave face. Being the foundation that everyone needs, being the rock that you need. Putting everyone before yourself. I see you. I feel you. Carrying the weight around your neck. I see you in the small hours nursing, dreaming of sleep, writing your to do list in the dark, by the light of your phone, responding to messages you&rsquo;d forgotten you even had from last week. I see you awkwardly compressed between a rock and a hard place on your daily 2 hour commute. I see you, working in a job that daily robs you of your joy, quietly stuck in commuter pain, sandwiched between optimism and hopelessness surrounded by people who need to become familiar with deodorant. Overheating, overworked, underpaid and underappreciated. Wondering when the cycle will end. Hoping for deliverance, escape, or the luck of the Irish when that euro millions advert comes on. I see you doing the daily school run, sprinting from the car to the school gates, reciting the list of chores in your head as you head back to the car, praying for a day off. </p>

<p>You pick yourself up when things get tough. People sometimes ask you how you are but rarely listen for the truth. You make excuses for your nearest and dearest, no one seems to care enough, and you&rsquo;re alone, firefighting and trying to keep your head above water.</p>

<p>If we were honest about how we are feeling if not for public scrutiny, at least for ourselves then maybe we&rsquo;d find the strength to face them and stop saying we&rsquo;re ok, for fear of burdening others, being shunned by others, being misunderstood, or simply ignored. Or maybe sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to just pretend it&rsquo;s not happening and maybe it will all just go away…</p>

<p>Rarely… things rarely just disappear. Sometimes verbalising your truth brings it into reality, shit gets real when you start talking about it. Talking is good. Talking is freedom and relief. Talk to the right people, find solutions and support. But whatever you&rsquo;re going through, however tough or impossible it may seem, there will be an end. I hope you surround yourself with light and love. That you find beauty in ashes. Believe it or not, your worst day to someone else is a dream come true. This week has been exhausting for me on so many levels. I&rsquo;ve had to push through so much pain to get stuff done. I felt drawn to write this post for you to know you&rsquo;re not alone. Don&rsquo;t give up, and speak up. It&rsquo;s ok not to be ok.</p>

<p>Find someone to talk to, who’ll listen, someone you trust who cares, call the Samaritans or just message me, privately&hellip;you’re not alone, be heard.  Thanks for reading!

            <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of the term <strong>Hangry</strong>? It’s a clever portmanteau of hungry and angry, and an adjective that describes being irritable due to hunger, a term to describe that feeling you get when you’re hungry, and about to knock someone the hell out if you don’t get some food fast!</p>

<p>Well I’ve felt like that often, so I’m known for carrying around snacks and planning my life around where the nearest eatery is. I can pretty much describe anywhere I’ve been in the world in relation to good food. Sorry not sorry. I hate being hungry and am blessed to live comfortably enough to never have to experience this feeling unless I’m caught out somewhere remote or just lose track of time and there isn’t a drive through in sight. I’m a self confessed hangry person. Like I need food and am just distracted by it’s absence to the point of vexness, so I just don’t go there and prepare like a girl scout as it’s not a pretty site!</p>

<p>I’d like to think I’m pretty level headed and don’t have any known conditions that affect my ability to respond proportionately to situations. I’m rational, logical, don’t suffer fools much but I’m generally patient…ish. … or at least that’s what I thought! Until I got married and had babies!</p>

<p>Have you heard of the saying, ‘hell hath no fury like a woman scorned’? I’m not so sure it’s comparable to an angry mum! Now I’m coining a new word. <strong>Mumgry!</strong> I can’t be the only one to have felt this silent rage creeping up when your partner is snoring whilst your exhausted body struggles to stay awake and feed the baby? Or when he forgets to load the dishwasher after you cooked dinner, did the laundry, hoovered and painted the Sistine chapel, and says he’ll do it in the morning. It’s that uncontrollable urge to throw a heavy implement at someone you love because for that split second you are seething and just wish they understood the pressure you feel, the exhaustion you’re experiencing and the complete and utter overwhelm that is engulfing you. It’s a time when you feel like your brain has gone to mush, when you can’t remember if you put diesel or petrol in the car. When you breastfeed on demand in a taxi and rush out of the taxi with your boob out until you get home, and no one tells you!</p>

<p>I don’t know the statistics but I’m pretty confident that one of the biggest factors resulting in relationship breakdown is the arrival of children. It changes the dynamics of your partnership. It really separates the men from the boys, and the women from the girls. It exposes your ride or die for the sweet talk he’s been spinning for years. He’s not ride or die, he’s let me sleep or I’ll die! The realisation that this sexy man whom you gave up your uterus for, is now the object of your dissatisfaction and in fact the focus of your vehemence is a little unnerving and can swerve out of nowhere. Even the most laid back of couples can have their mumgry moments. It’s usually a completely understandable response to something that just pushes you over the edge, but because of the new baby and the sleep deprivation people think you’re losing it or are in some hormonal abyss. Hormones may have a huge part to play in it, but it’s also just a whole lot of change and a whole lot of exhaustion, mixed in with expectations, trying to maintain a somewhat functioning household and the fact that sometimes people are just sleep walking into family life and not pulling their weight.</p>

<p>Women tend to be the primary care givers, regardless of the life they had before children, and even those who made more money than their partners unfortunately can’t hand over child bearing duties, and alot of the time the gender stereotypes and society’s perception of the ‘norm’ results in women staying at home, men getting insignificant time off for paternity leave and women left holding the baby.</p>

<p>Somehow we’ve allowed society to tell us that we’re better at nurturing and that essentially gets men off the hook. Maternal instinct doesn’t come naturally for everyone. Most of us have to work at being mums. We learn on the job and it’s tough even for Mary Poppins understudies. But we do our best, and always show up, which is half the battle.</p>

<p>But how do we keep mumgry under control? Just like my detailed planning required to avoid hangry moments, I too need to work on the cues for mumgry ones. And share the trigger points with my partner so he knows what the deal is. So whether it’s chores, finances, sex, socialising, or you’ve simply got beef over hogging the remote control, it’s all fixable, if you both want it to be fixed. Children are an amazing gift that come with unfettered joy and challenges, remind yourself of the love it took to have them and put maintaining that love high on your to do list, above the laundry!</p>

<p>Changing your focus is definitely key. Being comfortable is great, but don’t be complacent. Don’t take your partner for granted, don’t assume anything. Make time for each other. Everyone wants to be heard, understood and loved. Communicate! Write a list of weekly chores and divvy them up. Put it somewhere you can both see. If you both write it the onus on whose responsibility it is to ensure they’re completed changes. It’s our responsibility. If we fail, we fail together, and we can ease the mental load on women just a little bit.</p>

<p>As I write this post, breastfeeding, coughing and full of cold and trying to eat my breakfast. I say that the cough I have is causing me some pain in my stomach. My husbands response is, ‘great babes, those are the muscles where you’re supposed to have abs, you’re building your pack back!’ I can just feel another mumgry moment coming on, so I’m about to play some classical tunes and finish this up! Wishing you light and love and laughter and no police cautions.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your mumgry moments and if you’ve got any coping mechanisms please share! Thanks for reading! Please like, share and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinualikor/">follow me</a>.</p>
